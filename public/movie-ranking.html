<h2>My top 5 go-to movies</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Bad Boys 2</h3>
<p>Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are hilarious in this comedy action thriller!
    They play two detectives trying to bust up the Miami drug scene by shutting down an
    ecstacy operation. One is single, flashy, and reckless; while the other is a low key 
    family man trying to make peace with his past. The laughs come as often as the action
    and that's why I never get tired of watching this cult classic.

<h3>Moana</h3>
<p>Moana is a tribal princess whose island is dying. 
    The food source is scarce and the only way for the poeple of the island to survive is to 
    travel by ocean to new place. Only one problem, the Cheif, her father has forbidden it. After 
    hearing stories from her Grandmother about how the island got sick, Moana knows exactly what 
    she must do to save her people.

<h3>The Gray Man</h3>
<p>I love thrillers and this is one of my new favorites! It's about the CIA recruiting felons to 
    be apart of an off the books program doing government dirty work. When Siera Six, or Six as he's called 
    is hired for a job, he soon learns that he was contracted to take out one of his own. Given an 
    object by the man he is ordered to kill, puts Six on the crosshairs of some very powerful people, and he 
    is immediately in danger.

<h3>Bullet Train</h3>
<p>This one reminds of a Quentin Terentino style movie in the way it jumps in and out of past and present. It's 
    about two contract killers that are paid to rescue a Shadowy figures son and breifcase, and return them to the 
    father. While another man is hired to locate and retrieve the breifcase and yet another man is looking for the 
    person who pushed is son off a roof. They all happen to be passengers on the same train and chaos ensues. They are all
    also connected in a way none of them know.
</p>

<h3>Sweet Home Alabama</h3>
<p>This is my favorite chick-flick and it's hilarious! It's about a woman who tries to leave her 
    country roots behind and make it as designer in the Big Apple, but circumstances soon have her returning home to clean 
    up her past. But what she thought was going to be a quick and easy soluiton turns out to be a whole lot more. It's a
    good story, great cast, and lots of laughs.
